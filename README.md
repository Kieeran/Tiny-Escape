A tiny robot has to face hard challenges and go through struggles. His prizes are not only an antidote but also funny experiences.

Tiny Escape is our computer graphics course project, created using JavaScript and HTML. The game's inspiration comes from [Grounded](https://store.steampowered.com/app/962130/Grounded/) - a 3D sandbox survival game.
