A tiny robot has to face hard challenges and go through struggles. His prizes are not only an antidote but also funny experiences.

Tiny Escape is our computer graphics course project, created using JavaScript and HTML. The game's inspiration comes from [Grounded](https://store.steampowered.com/app/962130/Grounded/) - a 3D sandbox survival game.

## Objectives
- Create and load both static and animated 3D models into scene
- Perform basic transformations in computer graphics
- Study and apply material properties, texture, animations, lighting techniques, and camera settings
